# Baystation

Hi there. Welcome to baystation. We're a Space Station 13 server and community, and one of the oldest around. You can [check out our archives](https://github.com/orgs/Baystation12/repositories) if you're looking for something old but, otherwise, here's our current active project list:

[**Baystation**](https://github.com/Baystation12/Baystation12) - The actual game server.

[**Arrivals**](https://github.com/Baystation12/Arrivals) - A new joinee terms display and filtration media.

[**Warden**](https://github.com/Baystation12/Warden) - An front proxy for packet inspection, in its infancy.

[**ExCom**](https://github.com/Baystation12/ExCom) - A discord bot for server status display and admin commands.
